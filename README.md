On-the-fly inventory system: add items, track inventory, print QR codes

AdHoc Inventory is designed to allow a small business to get off the ground with limited overhead for inventory management. Users will able to add inventory items, create QR codes, track items and remove items from inventory ("sell" them). It does not include a Point-Of-Sale terminal: I suggest [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) or [Square](https://squareup.com/).

# Remote storage
Using Parse, you and your employees will be able to create a secure inventory system. Create one account using the SignUpViewController and you're ready to go!

# Hardware
In order to fully use AdHoc Inventory, you'll need a wirelessly available label printer to print your QR codes. After I've done some research, I'll add suggested printers here.
